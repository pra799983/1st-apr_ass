    "The purpose of grid search with cross-validation (GridSearchCV) in machine learning is to systematically search for the best combination of hyperparameters for a given model. Hyperparameters are settings or configurations that are not learned from the data but need to be specified before training the model.\n",

    "GridSearchCV works by exhaustively trying all possible combinations of hyperparameters within a predefined search space and evaluating each combination using \n",

    "\n",
    "Define the Model and Hyperparameter Space:\n",

    "Cross-Validation:\n",
    "GridSearchCV performs cross-validation to evaluate the performance of each hyperparameter combination. Typically, k-fold cross-validation is used, where the dataset is \n",

    "Model Training and Evaluation:\n",
    "For each combination of hyperparameters, GridSearchCV trains a model on the training folds and evaluates its performance on the validation fold. The evaluation metric\n",

    "Data leakage refers to the situation where information from outside the training dataset inadvertently leaks into the model during the training process. It occurs when the\n",

    "Overfitting: When data leakage occurs, the model may learn specific patterns or relationships that exist only in the leaked information. Consequently, the model becomes \n",

    "Maintain a Clear Temporal Order:\n",
    "If your dataset has a temporal component, such as time series data, ensure that the data is sorted chronologically. Split the data into training and testing sets in a way \n",

    "Avoid Using Future Information:\n",
    "When selecting features for your model, ensure that you do not include any information that would not be available at the time of prediction. This includes variables that \n",
    "are calculated or derived from future information or target variable leakage. Be cautious about using variables that are correlated with the target variable but could \n",
    "change after the target variable is determined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Proper Cross-Validation Techniques:\n",
    "When performing cross-validation, make sure to maintain the integrity of the temporal order. For example, if you are using k-fold cross-validation, shuffle the data before\n",
    "splitting to avoid any systematic patterns related to time. Use techniques such as forward chaining or rolling window validation that mimic real-world scenarios where data \n",
    "becomes available over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Engineering:\n",
    "Be mindful of feature engineering steps that could introduce data leakage. Feature transformations or calculations should only be based on information available at the time\n",
    "of prediction. Ensure that no information from the testing or evaluation data is used in the feature engineering process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Constantly Validate Assumptions:\n",
    "Regularly check your model and pipeline to ensure there are no unintended data leakage sources. Validate that the data used for training and evaluation adheres to the \n",
